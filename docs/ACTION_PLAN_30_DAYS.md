## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Integration Issues
**Risk:** Components may not work as expected in production pages
**Mitigation:**
- Start with homepage (high visibility, forces fixing)
- Document all issues immediately
- Allocate buffer time (Days 3-4) for fixes

### Medium Risk: Testing Learning Curve
**Risk:** Team unfamiliar with testing framework
**Mitigation:**
- Choose simple framework (Vitest)
- Start with simple tests
- Pair programming for first tests
- Focus on critical paths only

### Medium Risk: Time Constraints
**Risk:** Tasks take longer than estimated
**Mitigation:**
- Buffer time built into each week
- Can skip video background if blocked
- Can defer some tests to Week 5
- Daily progress check

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Potential Blockers
1. **Video file for homepage** - Can use fallback image if unavailable
2. **CI/CD access/permissions** - Resolve in Week 1 if possible
3. **Testing framework decision** - Choose by Day 20
4. **Form backend** - Not needed for client-side validation

### External Dependencies
- None critical for this 30-day plan
- Hosting/deployment can wait until Month 2

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups (Optional)
